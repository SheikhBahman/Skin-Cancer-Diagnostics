Course Project: Skin Cancer Diagnostics

Please see the report PDF file for more detailes.

# Dicription
In this project I am asked to ansewer the following questions using different statistical methods (without using deep-learning)
Question 1: As a data scientist, you are asked to construct classification models for identifying malignant moles based on the pixels (RGB colors) of these images.
Question 2: Your collaborator does not like the pixel model because it is not interpretable. Can you propose new data processing/feature engineering approaches that improve the interpretability and model accuracy?
